"""Tests for spec_transition.py — the two spec transitions a person makes by hand (0011).

Both change frontmatter, and both carry a rule. The rules are the point: without them these
would be a generic "set any field" command, which would be the one write path in this system
with no rule attached and would quietly become how everything gets changed.

# Spec 0042 — Reject a duplicate claim

## Goal
Stop paying the same claim twice.

## Why
It has happened.

## Scope

### In scope
- The submission endpoint

### Out of scope
- Refunds

## Acceptance Checks
- [ ] A duplicate submission returns 409 with body `{ "error": "duplicate claim" }`

## Risk Tier

**Tier:** HIGH
**Why this tier:** it touches money movement.

## Delegation Plan
- **Scope (file patterns):** the claims service only
- **Context (pattern to reuse):** the existing submission path
- **Permissions:** build and test auto-allowed
- **Gated paths touched:** none

## Checking Plan

**Ladder depth:** HIGH
**Specifics:** the full ladder, with a named sign-off.

## Decision List
- None.
