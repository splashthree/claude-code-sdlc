"""Tests for project_settings.py — every project setting and the file that owns it (0012).

This module composes and decides nothing, so the tests are about two things: that each
section names the file it came from, and that MISSING is reported as missing rather than as
broken. Those two send a person to different places — one to a file they need to create, the
other to one they need to fix — and conflating them is the failure worth catching.
