"""Tests for gate_auth.py — how the review gates sign in to Claude.

This script handles a real credential, so the tests are mostly about what it must NEVER do.
The happy path is one call to the code host; the value is entirely in the refusals.

  THE CREDENTIAL NEVER TOUCHES DISK. Not a config file, not a cache, not a temporary file. The
  code host already stores it encrypted, and a second copy on a laptop is a second thing that
  can leak — from the machine more likely to be lost.

  IT NEVER APPEARS IN A COMMAND LINE. An argument is visible to anything that can list
  processes. It goes through standard input instead.

  IT IS NEVER ECHOED, not even back at the person who mistyped it. A refusal that quotes the
  value puts it in a terminal history and in any screenshot of the failure.

  A WRITE IS READ BACK. This credential's failure mode is silent and late: a gate that cannot
  sign in fails on somebody ELSE's pull request, long after the person who set it walked away.
