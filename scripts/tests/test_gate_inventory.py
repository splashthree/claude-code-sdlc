"""Tests for gate_inventory.py — every gate a change must pass (spec 0013).

The gates are described once, in the rails operator's guide. This module turns that table
into data WITHOUT becoming a rival description, so the tests are mostly about faithfulness and
about the three-way classification spec 0013 asks for:

  installed   described and present — a real gate on real changes
  missing     described but absent — the playbook ships it, this project does not run it
  unexpected  present but undescribed — this project's own gate, shown rather than hidden

The failure worth catching hardest: reporting "no gates" when the truth is "the guide could
not be read". Those look identical on screen and mean opposite things — one is a project with
no protection, the other is a tool that could not look.

## The gates

| Gate | File | Fires on | Blocks or advises |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **build-and-test** | `ci.yml` | every PR | **Blocks** (hard gate) |
| **spec-gate** | `ci.yml` | every PR | **Blocks** — `no-spec:chore` is the recorded escape |
| **eval-gate** *(optional)* | `ci.yml` | every PR | **Blocks** — keep only if you ship evals |
| **grader** | `grader.yml` | every PR | **Advises** — never blocks |
| **Stop gate** | `.claude/hooks/stop-gate.ps1` | agent tries to finish | **Blocks** a red build |
