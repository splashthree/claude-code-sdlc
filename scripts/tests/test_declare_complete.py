"""Tests for declare_complete.py — can Build be declared finished (spec 0014).

A declaration is the one moment in this system where somebody says "we are done" out loud, in
writing, with their name on it. Everything here exists so that sentence is true when it is said,
so the tests are about the refusals:

  A REFUSAL NAMES WHAT IS OUTSTANDING. A refusal a person cannot act on is a wall; one that
  lists the specs and who is building each is a to-do list. Every blocker carries its items.

  ALL BLOCKERS AT ONCE, not the first. Somebody about to end a phase wants the list, not a game
  of whack-a-mole.

  A CONFIRMATION HAS A NAME ON IT. "The claims team confirmed" with nobody named is not a
  confirmation, and the point of asking each lead is whose assertion it is.
