"""What a stage still needs before it can be signed off — one read-only call (spec 0010).

Answering "is this stage ready?" previously took three or four separate calls and some text
parsing. This composes them into one JSON answer, for a UI that wants to show a person what is
missing and link each item to the field it refers to.

Two deliberate choices, both about not damaging the project while reading it:

  * **It never calls check_gates.py.** That script appends to `.sdlc/metrics/gate-log.jsonl` on
    every single invocation, with no flag to suppress it. A UI that polls readiness would
    silently inflate the project's own empirical-metrics record — the gate log would stop
    measuring gate runs and start measuring how often someone had a window open. So this reads
    the same registry conditions itself and leaves the log alone. check_gates.py remains the
    authority for actually passing a gate; this is the read-only view of the same question.

  * **Shapes are resolved by PATH, not by stamp.** check_document_completeness.scan_repo matches
    a document to its shape through the template stamp comment — but nothing in the pipeline
    (init_project.py, new_spec.py, the authoring agents) ever writes that stamp, so a
    stamp-based scan silently skips every document in a real project. `.sdlc/artifacts/<phase
    dir>/<name>.md` mirrors `templates/phases/<phase dir>/<name>.shape.yaml` exactly, which is
    the resolution that actually works today. The stamp is still tried as a fallback so this
    keeps working if stamping is ever wired up.

Exit code is always 0 — this reports, it never blocks. Dual --repo/--state, like its siblings.

Usage:
  stage_readiness.py [--phase 1] [--repo P | --state P] [--json]
