"""The top-level `host` block every host-touching `--json` carries (code-host providers, Wave 3).

`{name, source, cli, cli_state, detail}` — so a reader can see WHY a host was chosen and whether
its CLI answered. Two rules from the honesty table (docs/proposals/code-host-providers.md §8):

  * `cli_state` here is read from the OUTCOME of the call the script just made, never from a
    separate probe: a script that already asked the host does not spawn `gh auth status` or
    `az account show` a second time to say so (and the test suite, which never runs either CLI,
    would have no way to intercept it). The call went through → `available`; it failed → the
    failure text says which of not_installed / extension_missing / signed_out it was, else
    `unknown` — never a false "no".
  * "Unavailable" rides THIS block. It is never a fourth check state in connection_report and
    never `code_host_available: true` with an empty board in spec_status.

`describe_source` is the phrase the text footers use ("Code host: azure-devops (from origin)").
