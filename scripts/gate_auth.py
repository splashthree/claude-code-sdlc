"""How this repo's review gates sign in to Claude — set it, check it, remove it.

The correctness-review, security-review and grader gates run on the CODE HOST, not on anybody's
machine, so they cannot borrow a local Claude session. They need a credential of their own, and
this is the one supported way to put one there.

TWO WAYS TO SIGN IN, and the difference is money rather than capability:

  subscription   A token minted from your own Claude login (`claude setup-token`). The gates run
                 against your existing plan. No per-pull-request charge.
  api-key        An Anthropic API key. Metered — every pull request that touches source costs
                 real money at the model.

Both are offered because the choice is genuinely the operator's. A team that already pays for
Claude should not be told to start paying twice, and a team billing to a project cost code often
wants the API key precisely BECAUSE it is metered and attributable.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO — the whole reason it is one script rather than a README step:

  It never writes the credential to disk. Not to a config file, not to a cache, not to a
  temporary file. It reads it once from standard input, hands it to the code host, and lets it
  go. The code host already stores it encrypted; a second copy on a laptop is a second thing
  that can leak, and the laptop is the one more likely to be lost.

  It never prints it, and never puts it in a command line. A value passed as an argument is
  visible to anything that can list processes on the machine. This pipes it through standard
  input instead — which is also why `status` reports only WHETHER a credential exists, never
  any part of it.

  It refuses to guess. A token that does not look like what it claims to be is rejected before
  anything is sent, because a credential set wrong fails at the worst possible moment: on
  somebody else's pull request, as a gate that was supposed to be protecting them.

Standalone or Workflow (CLAUDE.md design rule):
  - Standalone: gate_auth.py --repo <path> status
  - Workflow:   gate_auth.py --state .sdlc/state.yaml status
Exit 0 on success; 1 when the credential could not be set or read. `status` always exits 0 —
"not configured" is an answer, not a failure.

CODE HOST (code-host providers). On GitHub everything above is as it always was — repository
secrets through `gh`, byte-identical. On Azure DevOps the pipelines take their secrets from
VARIABLE GROUPS (`- group: NAME` in .azuredevops/pipelines/*.yml), so `status` reads the variable
names in the groups the pipelines reference (`ado_import.secret_names`). `set` and `clear` are
NOT implemented for Azure DevOps (D-OWNER-6): they refuse with `kind: unsupported_host` and print
the exact `az pipelines variable-group variable …` command to run by hand — WITHOUT a value on
it, because az prompts for a secret's value on standard input when `--value` is omitted, which
is the same "never on a command line" rule this script keeps for `gh`. Chosen by the origin
remote; `--host` / `SDLC_CODE_HOST` / `.sdlc/code-host.yaml` override it.
