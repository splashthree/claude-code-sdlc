"""Report a spec's status, read from its pull request (spec 0006).

Once a spec is handed off, the truth about it lives in the code host: which checks ran,
what the grader said, who approved, whether it merged. This reads that — it never sets
status by hand and never votes on a gate. The one write it makes is `status: merged`, and
only once the PR has actually merged, committed straight onto the default branch (best
effort: a protected default branch may reject the push, which is reported, not fatal — the
read side of this tool must still succeed regardless).

Code host (code-host providers): the repository's `origin` decides whether the reads above go
through `gh` or, for an Azure DevOps remote, `az` (`--host` overrides). Every read dispatches
AT ITS CALL SITE through `_host_fn` to `ado_import.<same name>` when the host is Azure DevOps
and to this module's own function otherwise, so the GitHub path — argv, text, tests — is
byte-identical to what it was. The pure ladder (`compute_waiting_on`) never learns which host
it is reading; `ado_map` hands it the same gh-shaped dict.

Standalone or Workflow:
  - Standalone: --repo <path>
  - Workflow:   --state .sdlc/state.yaml

# The board shows hundreds of specs and has two seconds to do it. report_status() above is

# hundred specs is about three and a half minutes. This asks once instead: every pull
# request in one request, matched to specs locally by the branch-naming rule they already
# share.
#
# Two deliberate differences from report_status(), both of which the board can live with and
# neither of which it should pretend away:
#
#   * It NEVER WRITES. report_status() commits `status: merged` when it sees a merged pull
#     request; a board refreshing on a timer must not commit anything, and spec 0011 says
#     the status view offers no control that changes anything. Merging still gets recorded —
#     by the per-spec call, which is what runs when a person opens one.
#   * The grader's verdicts and the exact age of a review request each need their own
#     per-pull-request fetch, so they are not read here. `waiting_on` is computed from what
#     the one request returns, and `updated_at` is offered as "when this last moved" rather
#     than dressed up as "how long it has been waiting", which would be a different and
#     unmeasured thing.
