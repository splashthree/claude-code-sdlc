"""Change a project setting — validated first, written second (spec 0012).

Three settings, three files, three rules. Each verb writes only after the result would pass
the same validation the read side applies, so a settings screen cannot leave a project in a
state its own tooling rejects. The failure that prevents is specific: a roster saved with a
typo makes every later spec fail its owner check, and whoever broke it is three screens away
by the time anyone notices.

  person     Add or update someone in the roster (optionally their code-host `email`).
  limit      Set a team's work-in-progress limit.
  approval   Turn change-approval on or off for a stage.
  code-host  Pin which code host this repository is on (.sdlc/code-host.yaml).

NOTHING IS REGENERATED. Every write is a targeted edit that leaves the rest of the file
byte-for-byte alone, which matters more than it sounds: the first version of the roster write
parsed the file, changed the object and dumped it back. That was correct, passed validation,
and silently destroyed all nine comments its author had written. Losing what a person wrote is
the exact failure this whole product exists to prevent, so a settings screen must not be the
one place it happens. The same rule the document shape library follows for markdown applies
here.

Writes the file and nothing else: no commit, no branch, no push. Reaching the repository is
spec 0009's save, which is what makes a settings change an ordinary commit with a person and a
reason on it rather than a silent mutation.

Refusals happen BEFORE the file is touched, so a refused change leaves it exactly as it was.
