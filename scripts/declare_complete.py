"""Can Build be declared finished — and if not, exactly why (spec 0014).

A declaration is the one moment in this system where somebody says "we are done" out loud, in
writing, with their name on it. Everything below exists so that sentence is true when it is
said.

Three refusals, and each names what is outstanding rather than just saying no. A refusal a
person cannot act on is a wall; a refusal that lists the four specs and who is building each is
a to-do list.

  unfinished specs      Every spec must be merged or deferred. One that is neither is work
                        somebody still intends to do, and declaring over it means the
                        declaration is false the moment it is made.
  unconfirmed teams     Each team with a spec in the list confirms its own. The project owner
                        declares; the leads confirm what they are confirming. One person
                        asserting on behalf of four teams is a signature, not a check.
  no declaring person   A declaration with no name on it is an announcement nobody made.

WHY THE PLUGIN AND NOT THE SCREEN: the same reason every other rule in this system lives here.
A declaration refused only by an application is refused only until somebody edits the state
file, and this is the single most consequential write in the product.

What this does NOT decide is which specs "should" have been finished. It reports what the
backlog says. A spec deferred with a reason is a decision somebody made and recorded; this
counts it as decided, and does not second-guess it.

`check` is read-only and always exits 0. `declare` is the write, and it refuses before writing.
