"""Every gate a change must pass, in the order it meets them (spec 0013).

The gates are already described, once, in the rails operator's guide — a markdown table
giving each gate's file, what fires it, and whether it blocks or advises. This reads that
table and cross-references it against the pipeline files a project actually has.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO is describe the gates itself. A second description would
be a second source of truth, and the first time a gate changed, one of the two would start
lying — with no way for a reader to tell which. The guide is written for a person and kept
current because people read it; this turns it into data without becoming a rival copy.

Three answers, and the middle one is the point:

  installed    in the guide AND present in this project — a real gate on real changes
  missing      in the guide but NOT present here — the playbook ships it, this project does
               not run it. Spec 0013 asks for exactly this: a gate the playbook ships but
               this project does not have is absent, not listed as if it were protecting
               anybody.
  unexpected   present here but NOT in the guide — a gate this project added for itself.
               Shown rather than hidden: it gates real changes whether the playbook knows
               about it or not.

Read-only, always exits 0.

The pipeline directory follows the CI PLATFORM the harness manifest records (code-host
providers): `.github/workflows` for GitHub Actions — exactly as before — and
`.azuredevops/pipelines` for an Azure Pipelines install, so a gate is never called missing
because this looked in the other platform's folder. `installed_pipelines_dir()` is that rule.

Standalone or Workflow:
  - Standalone: --repo <path>
  - Workflow:   --state <path>/.sdlc/state.yaml
