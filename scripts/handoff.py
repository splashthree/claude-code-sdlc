"""Hand a ready spec to a developer in one step (spec 0005 — the Delegate beat's tool).

Today hand-off is four manual steps that each get skipped differently: the branch gets
named ad hoc, the spec's status goes stale, nobody is assigned, and the developer starts
without the spec in front of them. This makes it one step: branch, frontmatter, code-host
assignment, and (optionally) the Claude Code session itself.

Every refusal path (not ready, unknown developer, developer is also the checker, team at
its WIP limit, already in flight) runs BEFORE any git operation, so a refusal always leaves
the repository untouched — a half-done hand-off is worse than none. Git and GitHub are
deliberately separate: the branch/frontmatter/push happen over plain git, so a hand-off
still does its local half even with no code-host access; only the assignment step needs
the code host's CLI, and its failure is reported, not fatal.

Code host (code-host providers): the assignment step goes to `gh` on GitHub and to `az` on
Azure DevOps, chosen by the origin remote (`--host` / `SDLC_CODE_HOST` / `.sdlc/code-host.yaml`
ahead of it — `code_host.detect_host`). The GitHub path is byte-identical to what it was. On
Azure DevOps there is no assignee on a pull request, so the developer is named in the
description; the checker is added as a required reviewer by roster EMAIL, and a checker with no
email is an `assignment_error` (the PR still opens — the local half is never failed over it).
