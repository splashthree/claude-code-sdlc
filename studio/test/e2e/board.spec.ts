/** The Build board in the real window (spec 0011).
 *
 * The check that matters most here is the last one. Spec 0011 asks for a board of 200 specs
 * across 4 teams to open in under two seconds, and its Checking Plan tells the reviewer to
 * confirm that was MEASURED, not assumed. The data half is already measured — 1.2 seconds,
 * one code-host request regardless of spec count — but rendering two hundred rows was, until
 * this file, an untested assumption. So the fixture builds two hundred real specs and the
 * test times the real window.
 *
 * Everything else here is the read-only promise: the status view offers no control that
 * changes anything, which cannot be proven by a function test — only by looking at what is
 * on screen.
