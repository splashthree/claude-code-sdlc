/** Which pull request Studio is willing to merge on its own.
 *
 * Spec 0010's security pass found this merging `prs[0]` from a name search. A search is not
 * an exact filter and it returns other people's pull requests too — on a public repository,
 * anyone's, opened from a fork. Studio then merged it into the protected default branch with
 * the user's credentials, which is precisely the branch protection and review requirement
 * that sent the save down the pull-request path in the first place, undone.
 *
 * Every case below is a way that could happen. The rule is deliberately all-or-nothing:
 * Studio merges the exact branch it pushed, opened by the signed-in account, from this
 * repository rather than a fork.
