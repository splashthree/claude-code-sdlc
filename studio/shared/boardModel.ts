// Lives in shared/ rather than beside the main process because BOTH sides use it: the
// window filters and groups with it, and it is tested directly. (Its sibling types.ts must
// stay types-only for its own reason — it is included in two separate TypeScript projects
// that have no built output to reference each other through. That rule is about that file,
// not about this directory.)
//
// The Build board's logic (spec 0011) — pure, so it can be proven directly.
//
// Nothing here reads a file or spawns a process. That is deliberate and it is the spec's own
// requirement, not a testing preference: "switching role views does not re-read the
// repository". The board is fetched ONCE and every view of it — role, search, filter,
// grouping — is a transformation of what is already in hand. If any of this needed the
// repository, switching a tab would hit the disk and the network, which is both slow and a
// different answer each time for no reason the person did anything to cause.
//
// The other rule shaping this file: Studio computes no status of its own. Every value below
// comes from a spec's own frontmatter or from its pull request, as reported by the plugin.
// The one thing computed here is "is this waiting on me", which is a comparison, not a
// judgement — and it compares handles the plugin supplies, never prose it wrote.
