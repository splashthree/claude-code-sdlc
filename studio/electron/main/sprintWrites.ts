// The closed argv table's spawn side (togo-command-center.md §2.4). The renderer hands over a
// `SprintVerbRequest`; `shared/sprintVerbArgv.ts` (pure, golden-tested) turns it into exactly
// `[verb, …flags, '--by', actor]` or a list of reasons it refuses to; this file adds the
// `--repo`/`--state` source after the verb, spawns `sprint.py` ONCE, and reports the exit code
// as the truth: 0 "Done", 1 "Not done", 2 "Refused by the plugin". No JSON is parsed — the write
// verbs print prose and the dialog shows stdout/stderr verbatim. `--field` has no row in the
// table and can never be emitted. No actor → refused here, before any spawn, with
// `reasons.NO_ACTOR`. Every spawn, whatever its exit, invalidates the command center's local
// blocks so the next read is fresh; an exit 0 also warms that read (`warmCommandCenter`) so the
// renderer's post-verb re-read joins one fan-out instead of starting a second.
