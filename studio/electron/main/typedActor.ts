//
// Azure DevOps signed in with a PAT alone, or either host signed out, gives Studio no identity —
// and every actor-gated control (sign-off, restore, confirm) would stay dark. The owner's ruling:
// a typed name is allowed in exactly that situation, held here per project for THIS process only
// (never in settings.json — a name that outlives the session would be mistaken for an identity
// the host vouched for), and labelled wherever it leaves Studio: `ConnectionInfo.accountSource`
// says 'typed', and Studio's own commit messages carry TYPED_NAME_SUFFIX. The plugin's ledgers
// receive the plain name, because the plugin has no provenance field and a suffix there would
// break `@handle` matching.
//
// Validation is the main process's job (the renderer cannot be trusted to refuse), and it
// mirrors scripts/findings_model.py's `is_ai_actor` word list: this is labelling, not a lock —
// it cannot verify identity, only refuse the obvious.
