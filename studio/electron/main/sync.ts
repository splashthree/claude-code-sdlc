// Repository sync (spec 0009) — the orchestration layer. Pull, save, and clash resolution,
// built on git.ts (the plugin's own proven git contract), sectionMerge.ts (the pure
// per-section 3-way merge), and settings.ts (Studio's local ancestor bookkeeping — see
// decision 4 in the spec's plan: no scratch clone, every git operation runs straight
// against the person's real project folder, because fetch and the plumbing commands used
// here never touch a working file, so there's nothing to isolate them from).
//
// Everything that talks to the CODE HOST — who is signed in, the pull-request fallback when
// a direct push is refused, the poll that merges Studio's own pull request — goes through the
// provider codeHost.ts resolves for the project (GitHub via gh, Azure DevOps via az; code-host
// providers, Wave 6). This file never names a CLI: it asks the provider, and when the provider
// cannot answer it says why in the §7.1 wording rather than failing on an ENOENT.
