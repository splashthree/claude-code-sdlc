// Everything else in Studio that finishes a phase is `advanceAfterDeclaration` in board.ts, but
// that is reached only from Build's declare-complete flow. Every other phase — Discovery →
// Requirements, Requirements → Design, and on — still needed `/sdlc-next` in Claude Code to
// actually finish, because nothing in the window did what that command's own steps do: check
// the gates, confirm every judgement question, write and validate a condensed "frozen layer"
// summary of the phase, snapshot the artifact record, then advance.
//
// The frozen layer is the one step here that needs real LLM writing — every other step below is
// a script call, same as the rest of this file's siblings. Claude cannot read files in this
// call (see claudeAssist.ts): every artifact's text is read here and pasted into the prompt.
