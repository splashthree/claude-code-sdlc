// Handing a ready spec to a developer (spec 0011).
//
// Every rule about who may be handed what lives in the plugin's own command, and this file
// adds none of its own. That is Matt's resolved decision, and it is not just tidiness: a
// second copy of "a person cannot check their own build" living in the window is a rule
// enforced only in the app — which the spec's own Checking Plan tells the reviewer to look
// for, because a rule the app enforces is a rule a script can walk around.
//
// So Studio asks, and reports the answer. The one thing it does with the refusal is decide
// what to put on screen next — a reason box for a team at its limit, a different developer
// for a checker — and it reads the refusal's KIND for that, never its wording.
