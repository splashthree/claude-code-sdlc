// Which files in a project Studio may touch, and where they are actually allowed to point.
//
// This is one module rather than a helper inside sync.ts because the same two questions have
// to be answered in three places — syncing, documents, and history — and answering them in
// only one was the gap spec 0010's security pass found. The list lived in sync.ts and was
// enforced by sync.ts alone; every document and history call took whatever relative path it
// was handed and joined it to the project folder.
//
// Two separate checks, both needed, for different attacks:
//
//   isAllowlisted  — is this the KIND of file Studio edits? A path-string question.
//   resolveInProject — does this path actually END UP inside the project? A filesystem
//                      question, and the one a path string cannot answer. A repository can
//                      check in a file that is really a link to somewhere else on the
//                      machine, and every ordinary read or write follows it: reading would
//                      pull a private key into a merge screen and then push it to whoever
//                      owns the repository, and writing would drop remote-controlled content
//                      at a path of their choosing.
//
// (That link case needs git to materialize links, which is standard on macOS and Linux and
// usually off on Windows. Studio ships on all three.)
