// What happens to a finished candidate (spec 0027): Keep writes it, Discard does not. Both are
// recorded, and neither can lose the other's work.
//
// Keep is the one place a model job's text reaches the disk, so it is a single audited write:
//
//   1. Re-validate the target with the same guards a normal document write uses (allowlist, no link,
//      inside the project). The candidate was checked when the job started; the project may have changed
//      since, and this is the boundary that matters.
//   2. If a file is there, capture it into the version history FIRST (`audit_artifacts.py record --scan`)
//      and confirm the capture, because replacing a hand-corrected summary silently is the loss the
//      history exists to prevent. If it cannot be confirmed, nothing is written.
//   3. Write the whole document through a temp file and a rename, so a crash never leaves half a document.
//   4. Record it: the change (`created` or `revised`; the script has no "drafted" event) and the draft
//      outcome. A failure of either is a warning, never a reason to lose the document just written.
