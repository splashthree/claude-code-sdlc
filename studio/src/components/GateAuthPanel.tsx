/** How the review gates sign in to Claude.
 *
 * The correctness-review, security-review and grader gates run on the code host, not on
 * anybody's machine, so they cannot borrow the Claude session this application is using. They
 * need a credential of their own, and this is where a person provides one.
 *
 * TWO WAYS, and the difference is money rather than capability — which is why the cost is
 * stated at the moment of choosing rather than left in a document somewhere:
 *
 *   subscription  a token minted from your own Claude login. No per-pull-request charge.
 *   api key       metered. Every pull request that touches source costs real money.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCREEN DOES NOT DO, deliberately:
 *
 *   It never shows a credential back, not even masked. There is nothing to show: the value is
 *   handed to the plugin, which hands it to the code host, and nobody keeps a copy. The screen
 *   can say WHETHER one is set, and that is the whole of what it knows.
 *
 *   It never remembers what was typed. The field is cleared the moment it is submitted, and
 *   its contents are never put in application state that outlives the call.
 *
 *   It enforces nothing. Every refusal — a malformed credential, a repository the account
 *   cannot administer, a write the code host silently ignored — comes back from the plugin, so
 *   a person who configures this by hand is held to exactly the same rules.
