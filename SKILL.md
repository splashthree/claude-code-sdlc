# claude-code-sdlc

SDLC orchestration plugin for Claude Code. Drives projects through a 9-phase software development lifecycle with company-configurable profiles, compliance gates, and quality enforcement.

## What This Does

This plugin makes structured SDLC methodology executable in Claude Code. It provides:
- **9 phases** — gated open (Discovery, Requirements, Design, Foundation) and gated close (Documentation, Deployment, Monitoring, Close & Transfer) bracketing a continuous **Build loop** (Intent→Delegate→Discern per change, no batch exit gate)
- **Company profiles** (YAML) defining stack, quality thresholds, compliance frameworks, and conventions
- **7-gate validation** at every phase transition (integrity, completeness, metrics, compliance, consistency, quality, exit criteria)
- **Compliance enforcement** for SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS
- **Skill orchestration** — maps each phase to existing Claude Code skills (`/deep-plan`, `/deep-implement`, `/tdd`, `/code-review`, `/security-review`, `/e2e`, etc.)

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/sdlc-setup` | Interactive setup wizard — select profile, initialize `.sdlc/` in your project |
| `/sdlc` | Show current phase guidance, next action, required artifacts |
| `/sdlc-status` | Progress dashboard with phase table and completion percentage |
| `/sdlc-gate` | Run exit criteria checks for current phase (does not advance) |
| `/sdlc-next` | Advance to next phase if all MUST gates pass |
| `/sdlc-enhance` | Generate narrative companions for stakeholder review (optional) |
| `/sdlc-coach` | Interactive coaching mode — adaptive dialogue for current phase |
| `/sdlc-intake` | Catalog and summarize an external document corpus (Phase 0, opt-in) |
| `/sdlc-brief` | Prep a stakeholder workshop brief from the document corpus |
| `/sdlc-spec` | Author a ready Build-loop spec (`specs/NNNN-name.md`) and enforce the Definition of Ready |
| `/sdlc-handoff` | Hand a ready spec to a developer — branch, frontmatter, code-host assignment, starting the agent |
| `/sdlc-spec-status` | Report a spec's status read from its pull request — checks, grader verdict, approvals, merge |
| `/sdlc-sprint` | Sprint board — slate a count of specs by risk-tier mix, ready the sprint once every slated spec clears the DoR and its Eng/Data verdicts, close it with kept / carried / dropped (advisory; never a gate) |
| `/sdlc-refine` | Refinement agenda for the sprint's specs — DoR gaps, pending verdicts, overdue decisions; refine one spec or the whole slate; record Eng/Data verdicts; route upstream fixes without regressing a phase |
| `/sdlc-report-issue` | Bugs in the product, from report to fix — an interview that forces the minimum a fixer needs (what / expected / steps, the product's channel with its follow-ups, environment and build, severity, frequency, data impact, the type of user and your role, a real screenshot, a privacy statement); reviewed by someone other than the reporter, prioritized P1–P3 with a target sprint, promoted to a `type: bugfix` spec that `--slate` puts into the sprint; `sync` marks it fixed when the spec merges; `file` opens it on GitHub / Azure DevOps |
| `/sdlc-review` | Multi-perspective artifact review (council, adversarial, or edge-case modes) |
| `/sdlc-phase-report` | Generate phase HTML report with artifact inventory and gate results |
| `/sdlc-audit` | Analyze gate effectiveness across completed phases — identify always-pass and high-fail gates |

## Quick Start

1. Run `/sdlc-setup` in your project directory
2. Select a profile (e.g., `microsoft-enterprise` or `starter`)
3. Run `/sdlc` to see Phase 0 guidance
4. Work through each phase, creating required artifacts
5. Run `/sdlc-next` when ready to advance

## How It Works

The plugin maintains state in `.sdlc/state.yaml` in your project directory. Each phase has:
- **Entry criteria** — what must be true to start the phase
- **Workflow** — steps to follow, skills to use
- **Required artifacts** — files you must produce (stored in `.sdlc/artifacts/XX-phase/`)
- **Exit gates** — 7-gate validation that must pass before advancing (gated phases only; the Build loop checks per change instead)

Phase transitions are atomic — either all MUST gates pass and you advance, or none do and you get a blockers report.

For long-running phases (especially the Build loop), the spec is the durable source of truth across sessions — the agent re-reads it every session, and `scripts/track_specs.py` derives backlog progress from spec frontmatter. When the engagement runs sprints (`/sdlc-sprint`), the session start hook prints one `[SDLC-SPRINT]` line per active sprint record in `.sdlc/sprints/` (id, state, goal, start → end) so every session opens knowing the commitment window. The retired section-plan handoff summary (`session-handoff.json`) is no longer read by the hook.

## Profiles

Profiles configure the plugin for your company/team:
- `microsoft-enterprise` — C#/.NET 10 + Angular 22 + Azure + SOC 2 compliance
- `ado-enterprise` — microsoft-enterprise's stack on Azure Repos + Azure Pipelines. The
  harness install is platform-aware (no GitHub payload lands in the repo; rails
  governance content installs to `.azuredevops/rails/` instead), and `/sdlc-doctor` +
  the PR-flow rails check `az` instead of `gh`
- `ado-enterprise-python` — ado-enterprise's Python sibling: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy +
  React/Redux Toolkit on the same Azure Repos + Azure Pipelines rails, Azure Container
  Apps; setup asks PostgreSQL vs Azure SQL (Alembic either way)
- `starter` — Minimal profile, no compliance, quick start

Profiles define: technology stack, quality thresholds (coverage, file size limits), compliance frameworks, coding conventions (commit format, naming, immutability).

## Phases

Phase ids are strings (`build` and `close` are non-numeric); the 4/5/6 gap is intentional — batched check phases were replaced by per-change checking inside the Build loop. Advancement is always manual.

| id | Phase | Key Skills |
|----|-------|------------|
| 0 | Discovery | `/plan` |
| 1 | Requirements | `/deep-project` |
| 2 | Design | `/deep-plan`, `/visual-explainer` |
| 3 | Foundation | `/deep-plan` |
| build | Build Loop | `/tdd`, `/code-review`, `/security-review`, `/e2e`, `/test-coverage` |
| 7 | Documentation | `/update-docs` |
| 8 | Deployment | CI/CD |
| 9 | Monitoring | Manual |
| close | Close & Transfer | Manual |

## Writing Artifacts

Each phase's artifacts have a template in `templates/phases/<phase>/`. Studio, the gates and the
completeness check all read a document by its `##` headings, so a document that renames them is
treated as free text and none of its sections can be edited or checked. When you write an artifact:

- **Start from the template file and keep its `##` headings exactly** — same words, same names, no
  numbering added, none merged or dropped. You may add sections of your own; an added section is fine.
  What you write under each heading is yours; the headings are the contract.
- **Check it before moving on.** Run the phase's readiness check and fix every `section '…' not found`
  by using the template's heading for that content. A missing field you can genuinely fill, fill.

  ```bash
  uv run scripts/stage_readiness.py --repo . --phase <phase-id> --json
  ```

## Phase Layers (formerly "frozen layers")

After each phase completes (gates pass + human sign-off), a **phase layer** is generated — a token-efficient (1500-2000 token) summary of all phase artifacts. Phase layers:

- Enable cross-phase context continuity without reloading full artifacts
- Contain **locked metrics** (budget, timeline, scope) — carried forward and re-checked for consistency in later phases
- Are written to `.sdlc/context/layers/phase{N}-{name}.md`
- Are generated by Claude reading all phase artifacts and condensing them into the template at `templates/frozen-layer.md`
- Are validated by `scripts/validate_frozen_layer.py`
- Are **living, not frozen**: when a source artifact changes later (a requirement sharpened during `/sdlc-refine --upstream`, a `/sdlc-revise`, a `/sdlc-refresh`), the layer is regenerated, the previous version is kept as `.superseded-<date>`, and the regeneration is recorded in the artifact ledger. Earlier-phase artifacts are expected to change during refinement; the record keeps it honest, not a lock.

The `/sdlc-next` command handles layer generation as step 5 (after HITL sign-off, before state advancement). See `references/frozen-layers.md` for format details and the regeneration procedure.

## Context Architecture

The plugin uses a 3-tier context system for token-efficient cross-phase continuity:

| Tier | Content | When Loaded | Budget |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 Foundation | Project identity, constitution extract | Always (session start) | ~500 tokens |
| 1.5 Intake Index | Document corpus index with DOC-NNN IDs | Session start (when available) | ~5K tokens (configurable) |
| 2 Phase Layers | Living phase summaries with carried-forward metrics | Session start (recent 3) | ~2K per layer |
| 3 Reference | Validation rules, compliance, guides | On-demand | Unbounded |

The session-start hook automatically loads Tiers 1-2 (and 1.5 when document intake was performed). Tier 1.5 is opt-in — only loaded when `.sdlc/context/intake/index.md` exists. Tier 3 docs in `references/` are loaded when Claude needs specific guidance. See `references/context-tiers.md` for details.

## Narrative Enhancement

Every SDLC artifact can have a `.narrative.md` companion — a prose-rich, stakeholder-friendly version that makes the same information accessible to non-technical audiences. Narratives are **optional** (gates don't require them) but recommended before stakeholder reviews.

- Run `/sdlc-enhance` to generate narratives for the current phase's artifacts
- The `narrative-enhancer` agent handles all generation
- See `references/narrative-patterns.md` for transformation rules

## Multi-Perspective Review

Run `/sdlc-review` to evaluate phase artifacts from multiple angles before advancing. Three modes:
- `--council` (default) — 4-viewpoint review: Architecture, Product, Quality, Security
- `--adversarial` — Cynical QA: challenge assumptions, find quality issues
- `--edge-cases` — Exhaustive path analysis: find unhandled conditions and boundaries

Recommended before `/sdlc-gate` on design-heavy phases (2, 3) and during the Build loop. See `references/agent-roster.md` for phase-specific suggestions.

## Smart Repair

When gate checks fail on structural issues (missing templates, empty sections, placeholder content), the `gate-repair` agent can attempt automatic fixes before escalating to the human. Repair is conservative — it scaffolds structure but never generates substantive content. The human always reviews what was repaired. See `references/smart-repair.md` for the full repair classification.

## Conversational Coaching

For users who prefer guided dialogue over step lists, `/sdlc-coach` provides an adaptive coaching mode. The coach assesses the current phase state (which artifacts exist, what's missing), asks diagnostic questions, and generates artifacts as the conversation progresses.

Coaching mode enforces the same gates and requirements as the structured approach — it just changes the interaction style. See `references/conversational-coaching.md` for the full pattern library and per-phase diagnostic questions.

## Human-in-the-Loop Protocol

**This protocol is mandatory.** Claude MUST NOT make significant project decisions autonomously. The SDLC is a collaboration — Claude drives the process, humans make the decisions.

### When Claude MUST Stop and Ask

**1. Before writing any artifact in a new phase**
Read the incoming handoff document. Check for Q-NN (Open Questions) or AQ-NN (Architectural Questions). If any exist, resolve them with the human — using `AskUserQuestion` with concrete options — BEFORE writing any artifacts.

**2. Before writing any ADR (Phase 2 and beyond)**
Never choose an architectural approach without presenting options. For each decision:
- State the problem in one sentence
- Offer 2–3 concrete options with trade-offs
- Get a human selection
- Then write the ADR encoding that decision

**3. Before finalizing scope or requirements (Phase 0–1)**
Draft the key framing (executive summary, root cause statement, requirements list) and present it to the human for correction before writing the full artifact.

**4. Before writing section plans (Phase 3: Foundation)**
Present the proposed section breakdown — boundaries, order, complexity estimates — and get human approval before writing individual SECTION-NNN.md files.

**5. Before advancing any phase**
Do not call `advance_phase.py` immediately after gates pass. Present the phase summary and explicitly ask for human sign-off.

### What Claude May Do Without Asking

- Read files, search the codebase, explore project structure
- Write artifact drafts for human review (but flag them as drafts)
- Run gate checks and report results
- Format, organize, and structure content within a human-approved direction

### Pause Markers in Phase Definitions

Phase definition files use `> HITL GATE:` blockquotes to mark mandatory pause points. When Claude encounters one, it MUST stop and interact with the human before proceeding.

Phase definitions also use `> CHECKPOINT:` blockquotes to mark mandatory agent-enforced stopping points. The agent MUST complete all listed conditions before proceeding. Unlike HITL GATE, checkpoints do not require human interaction — they enforce workflow discipline within the agent's execution.

## Visual Report Protocol

**This protocol is mandatory for every phase.** Before requesting human sign-off to advance, Claude MUST generate an interactive HTML visual report summarizing the phase's artifacts, decisions, and key data. These reports replace ASCII art and inline markdown tables for stakeholder review.

### When to Generate

Generate a visual report as the **second-to-last step** of every phase, immediately before the "Generate Phase Report" step (which runs the gate check). The visual report is the stakeholder review artifact; the gate report is the automated validation artifact. Both are required.

### What Each Phase Report Contains

| Phase | Visual Report | Key Visualizations |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| 0 Discovery | Problem space overview | Persona cards, current state flow diagram, scope boundaries |
| 1 Requirements | Requirements matrix | Requirements by domain/priority, traceability matrix, epic overview |
| 2 Design | Architecture diagrams | Layer diagram, core flow, data flow, section dependencies, trust boundaries |
| 3 Foundation | Section review / spec backlog order | Section breakdown table, spec backlog order, dependency DAG, risk cards |
| build Build Loop | Build progress | Section completion status, test coverage dashboard, code metrics, review & security findings, test pass/fail by category |
| 7 Documentation | Documentation audit | Docs completeness matrix, API coverage, README status |
| 8 Deployment | Release checklist | Deployment readiness, environment status, rollback plan |
| 9 Monitoring | Monitoring dashboard | Health checks, alert configuration, baseline metrics |
| close Close & Transfer | Handoff & retrospective | Transfer checklist, lessons learned, final metrics, ownership map |

### How to Generate

1. **If `/visual-explainer` skill is available:** Invoke it with a detailed prompt describing the phase's data, the desired diagrams, and output path (`.sdlc/reports/phaseNN-visual.html`).
2. **If not available:** Generate equivalent self-contained HTML directly using Mermaid.js CDN for flowcharts/DAGs, HTML `<table>` for data tables, and CSS Grid for card layouts.
3. **Never fall back to ASCII art** in the final report. Inline text summaries are fine for chat, but the review artifact must be rendered HTML.

### Visual Standards

- Self-contained HTML (no external assets except CDN fonts and Mermaid)
- Dark theme default matching SDLC reports (`#0f1117` bg, `#6c8ef7` accent, `#4ade80` green)
- Sticky sidebar TOC for navigation between sections
- Zoom controls on all Mermaid diagrams
- Staggered fade-in animations (respect `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- Both light and dark theme support via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Responsive layout (sidebar collapses to horizontal bar on mobile)

### Artifact Sub-Pages (MANDATORY)

Every phase visual report MUST include linked sub-pages for each artifact. The main report is a summary; sub-pages contain full artifact detail.

- **Main report:** `.sdlc/reports/phaseNN-visual.html` (or `phaseNN-discovery.html`, etc.) -- summary with highlights from each artifact
- **Sub-pages:** `.sdlc/reports/phaseNN-<artifact-name>.html` -- full rendered content of each artifact (e.g., `phase00-problem-statement.html`, `phase00-constraints.html`)
- **Linking:** The main report's artifact inventory section MUST link to each sub-page. Each sub-page MUST link back to the main report.
- **Consistency:** Sub-pages use the same dark theme and styling as the main report.

This ensures the summary stays scannable while full detail is always one click away for stakeholder review.

### Project Index Page (MANDATORY)

An index page at `.sdlc/reports/index.html` MUST exist. It serves as the single entry point for all project documentation.

- **Auto-create:** Generate `index.html` when the first phase report is created (typically Phase 0).
- **Auto-update:** Update `index.html` every time a phase report is generated or a phase advances. Update phase status badges, dates, and report links.
- **Contents:** Project header (name, profile, type, start date, current phase), mission statement, link to constitution, and a timeline of all 9 phases showing status (active/completed/pending) with links to phase reports.
- **End state:** By project completion, `index.html` is a complete navigable dashboard of the entire SDLC history.

### Output Location

All reports are written to `.sdlc/reports/`:
- `index.html` -- project dashboard (single entry point)
- `00-discovery-visual.html`, `01-requirements-visual.html`, ..., `build-visual.html`, ..., `close-visual.html` -- phase summary reports. **Every phase uses its registry slug**, including the non-numeric `build` and `close`
- `00-discovery-<artifact>.html`, `01-requirements-<artifact>.html`, ... -- artifact sub-pages
- Additional named reports (e.g., `architecture-diagrams.html`, `03-foundation-section-review.html`) are encouraged alongside the phase report

## Agent Orchestration Protocol

Claude uses the Agent tool where a subagent buys something real: a perspective that did not write
the work, or a bounded search that would otherwise flood the main context. **Most phase work is not
delegated** — it is performed directly, as the phase definitions describe.

**Only spawn an agent that exists.** A spawn that resolves to nothing does not raise and does not
warn; the phase simply carries on as though the work were done. Every name below ships in
`agents/` or `harness/agents/`, or is a Claude Code built-in. See `references/agent-roster.md` for
the full mapping, and `scripts/tests/test_agent_references.py` for the check that keeps it honest.

### Mandatory Spawns (No Exceptions)

| Trigger | Agent | Behavior |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Build or compilation fails | `build-error-resolver` | Spawn immediately. Do not attempt manual fixes first. |
| Code touches auth, payments, secrets, or PII | `security-reviewer` | Foreground. STOP on CRITICAL/HIGH findings. |
| A change in the Build loop completes | `section-evaluator` | Foreground, blocking. FAIL verdict = fix before proceeding. |
| Gate check fails unexpectedly | `Explore` or `debugger` | Investigate root cause before attempting fixes. |

### Phase-by-Phase Agent Roster (Summary)

| Phase | Primary Agents | Conditional Agents |
|-------|---------------|--------------------|
| 0 Discovery | — | `Explore`, `discovery-analyst` |
| 1 Requirements | — | `Explore`, `requirements-analyst`, `feature-architect`, `bizreq-analyst` |
| 2 Design | `architect` | `security-reviewer`, `compliance-checker`, `data-analyst`, `visual-designer`, `conversation-designer`, `multi-reviewer` |
| 3 Foundation | `deep-plan:section-writer` | `Plan`, `planner`, `Explore` |
| build Build Loop | `section-evaluator` | `grader`, `security-reviewer`, `multi-reviewer`, `build-error-resolver`, `debugger`, `gate-repair`, `deep-implement:code-reviewer` (background) |
| 7 Documentation | — | `Explore` (ADR gap analysis) |
| 8 Deployment | — | `build-error-resolver` |
| 9 Monitoring | — | none |
| close Close & Transfer | — | none |

**Building is not delegated to a domain agent.** The Delegate beat is Claude building from an
approved plan under the rails; the checking ladder is what makes that safe, not a specialist
persona. Authoring work uses **skills** — `test-writer`, `api-pattern`, `spec-writer`, `pr-writer`,
`eval-builder`, `diagnose` — because a skill runs in the main context with the surrounding work in
view. Agents serve the Discern beat, where starting cold is the point.

### Parallel Execution Rules

**Use a single message with multiple Agent tool calls when:**
- A feature spans a web surface and a voice/chat surface — `visual-designer` and `conversation-designer` author different specs and do not conflict.
- Phase 3 (Foundation) has multiple independent section plans to generate.
- Several independent review lenses apply to the same change.

**Use sequential Agent calls when:**
- One agent's output is the input to the next.
- A security CRITICAL/HIGH finding must be resolved before proceeding.
- A build failure must be fixed before continuing.

**Pattern for parallel section planning:**
```
# Single message — two Agent tool calls fire simultaneously:
Agent(deep-plan:section-writer, "Generate the section plan for SECTION-002 per .sdlc/artifacts/03-foundation/")
Agent(deep-plan:section-writer, "Generate the section plan for SECTION-003 per .sdlc/artifacts/03-foundation/")
```

### Background Agents

Run with `run_in_background: true` (non-blocking):
- `deep-implement:code-reviewer` — diff review against section plans

Never background: security reviews, build error resolution, spec/section evaluation, or any work producing phase gate artifacts.
